# Real-World-Analytics-Assessment-4

As part of my master's degree, I had to complete this assessment in R Programming Language which focusses on Linear Programming Models for case studies. 

The first case study involves the development of a Linear Programming Model for a Clothes Factory that produces 3 types of Clothes from 3 different materials combines. The LP model was built an a number of demand constraints, raw material constraints and production constraints with the objective of maximizing the total profit.

The second case study involves the development of a Game Theory Linear Programming Model for a Two-Player-Zero-Sum Game which is a bidding process between Company 1 and Company 2 with the aim of finding the optimum strategy/strategies for Company 1 to win the bid.
